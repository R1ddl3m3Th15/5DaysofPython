mapit can redirect you to the Google Map of the entered destination using the Run terminal invoked using Windows Key + R
Then, just type in 

mapit <ADDRESS>

Note : Before using it, make sure to change the path of the batch file to the current destination of your mapit.py file.
And also add that path to your System Environment Variables to use the mapit command in the Run terminal properly as 
intended.
